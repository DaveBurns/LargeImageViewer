1. Download ImageMagick.tar.gz distribution to /Users/John.  Unpack it by doing:
    cd /Users/John
    tar xvfz ImageMagick.tar.gz
See http://www.imagemagick.org/script/advanced-unix-installation.php
2. Download the jpegsrc.tar.gz library from:
    http://www.imagemagick.org/download/delegates/
to /Users/John/ImageMagick and unpack it with:
    cd /Users/John/ImageMagick
    tar xvfz jpegsrc.tar.gz
    mv jpegsrc<version> jpeg
3. Configure and build the jpeg library:
    cd jpeg
    ./configure --disable-shared
    make clean; make
4. Download the libpng.tar.gz library from:
    http://www.imagemagick.org/download/delegates/
to /Users/John/ImageMagick and unpack it with:
    cd /Users/John/ImageMagick
    tar xvfz libpng.tar.gz
    mv libpng<verszion> png
5. Configure and build the png library:
    cd png
    ./configure --disable-shared
    make clean; make
6. Configure and build ImageMagick; copy configure.sh to ImageMagick folder and do:
    cd /Users/John/ImageMagick
    sh configure.sh
    make clean; make
7. Verify that composite is only loading dynamic libraries from /System and /usr/lib:
    otool -L utilities/composite
8. Copy utilities/composite and config/delegates.xml to anyfile.lrdevplugin.


And here's the contents of the "configure.sh" script referenced above:

# Image-magick configure script for configuring with Any File
# --disable-opencl \
./configure \
--disable-installed \
--disable-shared \
--enable-delegate-build \
--prefix=/ImageMagick-6.7.3-7 \
--disable-dependency-tracking \
--with-x=no \
--without-perl \
--with-freetype=no \
--with-jp2=no \
--with-tiff=no \
--with-magick-plus-plus=no \
--with-bzlib=no

Following up on this, this was great info and went pretty smoothly. The hiccup was when I wanted to include
TIFF support since I need that. It wasn't as trivial as the jpeg or png delegates and also required tweaks
to the main IM build. Here are my supplemental notes:

- Using the same pattern of commands as for the jpeg and png libraries above, download the latest tiff library from the IM site, unzip/untar it, and rename the directory to tiff/
- cd to tiff
- Config the TIFF build using "./configure --disable-shared --disable-lzma"
- run the build: "make"

- cd .. to the IM directory
- Use John's configure.sh file as above but add the following:
    --disable-opencl --with-tiff=yes --without-lzma CFLAGS="-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0"
- run the build: "make"
- as with John's notes, run otool to verify no non-core dependencies.

If it matters, I was using Xcode 4.6 and gcc version 4.2.1.
